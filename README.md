# Gravitational_Dynamics_Simulator
This simulator calculates real time gravitational forces between celestial bodies, allowing for accurate orbital mechanics, chaotic interactions, and relativistic black hole visualization.

Controls & Navigation :
Rotate View (3D): Right Click + Drag.
Pan Camera: Left Click + Drag (on empty space).
Zoom: Scroll.
Select Body: Left Click on any star or planet to lock the camera and view live data (Mass, Velocity, Distance).
Deselect: Click the [X] in the target panel or click empty space.
Simulation Templates :
Choose a preset scenario to start exploring:
Solar System: * Real scale simulation of our home system (Sun to Neptune + Dwarf Planets).
Real Date Loading: Use the date picker to align planets to their precise positions for any past or future date.
Binary Star: * Two massive stars (A Type and K Type) in a stable binary orbit.
Galaxy: * A supermassive black hole core surrounded by hundreds of stars in a spiral formation.
Black Hole: * Features TON 618 (The largest known Quasar) and Gargantua in a binary dance.
Demonstrates relativistic jets, accretion disks, and gravitational lensing.
Chaos Stars: * A randomized cluster of massive stars. Best for testing collisions and gravity assists.
Interaction Modes :
Available only in "Chaos Stars" and "Black Hole" templates.
View Mode: Standard camera control and selection.
Slingshot Mode: * Drag on Empty Space: Spawns a new star. Pull back to set velocity, release to shoot.
Drag on Existing Body: Applies an impulse force to change its orbit.
AI Architect :
The AI Architect allows you to build custom systems using natural language. It acts as a procedural generation engine powered by LLMs.
How to use:
Type a description in the text box (bottom right).
Click GO.
Example Prompts:
"A binary black hole waltz with a blue giant star."
"A chaotic swarm of 50 moons orbiting a central earth-like planet."
"A perfectly stable system with 1 sun and 8 planets."
"Galaxy Collision": Spawns two distinct galaxies on a collision course.
"Big Bang": Spawns a super-dense singularity that explodes outward radially.
Physics & Visuals :
Tidal Disruption Events (TDE): If a star gets too close to a Black Hole, it is ripped apart into a spiral of glowing debris.
Hawking Radiation: Black holes emit faint quantum particles that evaporate over time.
Collisions: Stars and planets can collide and merge. Their mass, velocity, and radius are conserved and combined.

Trails: 3D orbit trails show the path of celestial objects relative to the camera.
